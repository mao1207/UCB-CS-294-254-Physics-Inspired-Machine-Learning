# UCB-CS-Physics-Inspired-Machine-Learning
Machine learning in the context of scientific problems is an exciting emerging area of research. This course will give an overview of different physics-inspired machine learning methods, and the connections between concepts in physics (numerical methods, dynamical systems, symmetries, conservation laws) and machine learning.
